## Description

This was a great opportunity to practice creating functions within JavaScript. The goal was to give a fictional company a way to create an employee database by entering first and last name as well as their salary. This can be done for as many employees as needed. Also threw in a random employee selector and a average salary calculator. There are certain guardrails in place to try and mitigate user error as well.

## Installation

This is a simple webpage with popup windows. This is operational in any browser.

## Usage

All that you need to do is input the requested information: first name then last and then the salary. The average salary and the random employee selector comes up as two separate alerts. A table appears after these are closed.
